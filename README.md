# The Vulnerable Twenty (V20)

TransitionZero has partnered with the [V20 group](https://www.v-20.org/) to produce electricity sector data and modelling for a set of developing countries that are acutely vulnerable to climate change. The outputs of this modelling will be used in [Climate Prosperity Plans (CPP)](https://www.v-20.org/climate-prosperity-plans) to be published by V20. We have developed customised scenarios based on each countryâ€™s CPP and in conjunction with [Financial Futures Center (FCC)](https://financialfutures.ngo/), as well as regional stakeholders.

Specifically, we have collated data and developed models for:

1. ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¬ [Madagascar](https://github.com/transition-zero/tza-V20/tree/HTI/models/MDG)
2. ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡¹ [Haiti](https://github.com/transition-zero/tza-V20/tree/HTI/models/HTI)
3. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ [Philippines](https://github.com/transition-zero/tza-V20/tree/HTI/models/PHL)
4. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° [Pakistan](https://github.com/transition-zero/tza-V20/tree/HTI/models/PAK)
5. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡¦ [Gabon](https://github.com/transition-zero/tza-V20/tree/HTI/models/GAB)
6. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡² [The Gambia](https://github.com/transition-zero/tza-V20/tree/HTI/models/GMB)
7. ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¼ [Rwanda](https://github.com/transition-zero/tza-V20/tree/HTI/models/RWA)

# Getting started

## Setup

Firstly, clone or download this repository (or an older version). 

Next, create a project environment using the yaml file in the repository as below.

conda:

```
conda env create --name V20 --file env/V20.yml
conda activate V20
```

mamba:

```
mamba env create --name V20 --file env/V20.yml
mamba activate V20
```

Additionally, install a solver for optimisation. We recommend using [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/), which is free and open source.

## Usage (running a model)
You can run a model with just three lines of `python` code. For instance, you can run the Pakistan model as below:

```python
from tz.osemosys import Model
model = Model.from_yaml( path/to/pakistan/directory )
model.solve()
```

More information can be found in the [example notebook here](https://github.com/transition-zero/V20/blob/main/notebooks/run_model.ipynb).
